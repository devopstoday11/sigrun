# Backing up existing sigrun cluster configuration

To backup the existing configuration, save the config map named `sigrun-controller-config`. 
To load this backup at a later time, deploy the saved config map after sigrun has been installed.

This can also be used to transfer configuration from one cluster to another easily!
